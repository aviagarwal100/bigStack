//URL encoding is normally performed to convert data passed via html forms,
// because such data may contain special character, such as "/", ".", "#", 
//and so on, which could either: a) have special meanings; or b) is not a 
//valid character for an URL; or c) could be altered during transfer.  
// For instance, the "#" character needs to be encoded because it has a 
//special meaning of that of an html anchor.   The <space> character also 
//needs to be encoded because is not allowed on a valid URL format.   Also,
// some characters, such as "~" might not transport properly across the internet.
